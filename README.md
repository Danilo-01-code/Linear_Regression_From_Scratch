Project Objective
The goal of this project is to create machine learning models that presents clearly explained calculations, detailed annotations, and complete docstrings. In this way, data students or those who already work in the area will be able to deeply understand how machine learning models work unther the hood.

Through an accessible implementation, we seek to facilitate the learning of the fundamental and practical concepts involved in the development of predictive models. This project is ideal for those who want to deepen their knowledge and skills in machine learning.
